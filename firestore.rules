/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Geometra Application
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated assistance requests. GeoGebra applets are publicly readable.
 * @data_structure User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, and their assistance requests are stored in a subcollection `/users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}`. GeoGebra applets are stored under `/geoGebraApplets/{appletId}`.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users can only access their own profiles and messages.
 *   - GeoGebra applets are publicly readable.
 *   - User listing is not allowed.
 * @denormalization Not applicable. The current structure relies on path-based authorization.
 * @structural_segregation User data and public applet data are stored in separate top-level collections to enforce different access controls.
