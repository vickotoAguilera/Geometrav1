/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Geometra application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated assistance requests.
 * GeoGebra applets are publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores assistance requests (messages) for each user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /geoGebraApplets/{appletId}: Stores GeoGebra applets, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile and messages.
 * - GeoGebra applets are publicly readable, but write access is not defined in the IR, therefore it is denied.
 * - Listing of users is not allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is taken from the path and doesn't need to be stored inside the message document, as the path-based rules secure each `messageId` document.
